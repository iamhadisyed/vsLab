            <span style="font-weight: 400">
            Your privacy is important to us. Please read the ThoThLab Privacy Statement (the "Privacy Statement") as it describes
            the types of data we collect from you and your devices ("Data") and how we use your Data.
            The Privacy Statement also describes how ThoThLab uses your content, which is your communications with others;
            postings or feedback submitted by you to ThoThlab via the Services; and the files, photos, documents, audio, digital works,
            and videos that you upload, store or share through the Services ("Your Content").

            <span style="font-weight: 400">Many of our Services allow you to store or share Your Content or receive material from others.
                We don't claim ownership of Your Content. Your Content remains Your Content and you are responsible for it.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>When you share Your Content with other people, you understand that they may be able to, on a worldwide basis, use, save, record, reproduce, transmit, display Your Content without compensating you.
                    If you do not want others to have that ability, do not use the Services to share Your Content. You represent and warrant that for the duration of these Terms,
                    you have (and will have) all the rights necessary for Your Content that is uploaded, stored, or shared on or through the Services and that the collection, use, and retention of
                    Your Content will not violate any law or rights of others. ThoThLab cannot be held responsible for Your Content or the material others upload, store or share using the Services.
                </li>
                <li>To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others, to protect you and the Services, and to improve ThoThLab products and services,
                    you grant to ThoThLab a worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property license to use Your Content,
                    for example, to make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, display, and distribute via communication tools Your Content on the Services.
                    If you publish Your Content in areas of the Service where it is available broadly online without restrictions,
                    Your Content may appear in demonstrations or materials that promote the Service.

            <span style="font-weight: 600">Using Third-Party Apps and Services.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">
            The Services may allow you to access or acquire products, services, websites, links, content, material, games or applications from third parties (companies or people who aren't ThoThLab) ("Third-Party Apps and Services").
Many of our Services also help you find Third-Party Apps and Services, and you understand that you are directing our Services to provide Third-Party Apps and Services to you.
The Third-Party Apps and Services may also allow you to store Your Content or Data with the publisher, provider, or operator of the Third-Party Apps and Services.
The Third-Party Apps and Services may present you with a privacy policy or require you to accept additional terms of use before you can install or use the Third-Party App or Service.
You should review any additional terms and privacy policies before acquiring or using any Third-Party Apps and Services. Any additional terms do not modify any of these Terms.
You are responsible for your dealings with third parties. ThoThLab does not license any intellectual property to you as part of any Third-Party Apps and Services and is not responsible for information provided by third parties.

The Services, Third-Party Apps and Services, or material or products offered through the Services may be unavailable from time to time,
                    may be offered for a limited time, or may vary depending on your region or device.
                    If you change the location associated with your ThoThLab account, you may need to re-acquire the material or applications that were available to you and paid for in your previous region.
                </li>
                <li>
We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages,
                    and ThoThLab is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result.
In the event of an outage, you may not be able to retrieve Your Content or Data that you've stored.
                    We recommend that you regularly backup Your Content that you store on the Services or store using Third-Party Apps and Services.

                    We may change these Terms at any time, and we'll tell you when we do. Using the Services after the changes become effective means you agree to the new terms.
                    If you don't agree to the new terms, you must stop using the Services, close your ThoThLab account and, if you are a parent or guardian, help your minor child close his or her ThoThLab account.

                <li>
                    Sometimes you'll need software updates to keep using the Services. We may automatically check your version of the software and download software updates or configuration changes.
You may also be required to update the software to continue using the Services. Such updates are subject to these Terms unless other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other terms apply.
ThoThLab isn't obligated to make any updates available and we don't guarantee that we will support the version of the system for which you licensed the software.
                </li>
                <li>
Additionally, there may be times when we need to remove or change features or functionality of the Service or stop providing a Service or access to Third-Party Apps and Services altogether.
Except to the extent required by applicable law, we have no obligation to provide a re-download or replacement of any material, Digital Goods (defined in section 14(k)), or applications previously purchased.
We may release the Services or their features in a beta version, which may not work correctly or in the same way the final version may work.
                </li>
                <li>
So that you can use material protected with digital rights management (DRM), like some music, games, movies and more, DRM software may automatically contact an online rights server and download and install DRM updates.

                direct damages up to an amount equal to your Services fee for the month during which the breach occurred (or up to $10.00 if the Services are free).
                You can't recover any other damages or losses, including direct, consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, incidental, or punitive.
                These limitations and exclusions apply even if this remedy doesn't fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose or if we knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, these limitations and exclusions apply to anything or any claims related to these Terms, the Services, or the software related to the Services.
