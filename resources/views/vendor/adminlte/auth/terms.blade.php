    ThoTh Lab provides continuous services and support for users who have sign-up with our long-term service agreement. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and ThoTh Lab is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result.

                <li>
                    ThoTh Lab provides intermittent services for users who do not need to use their assigned resources continuously. Based on the intermittent service agreement, ThoTh Lab will monitor your assigned resource and put them in a sleep mode when there are no user-initiated activities for a given time period (or a time threshold). The current time threshold is set to 30 minutes. Entering the sleep mode, your data and application status will be maintained. You can resume the work after you wake up your allocated resources.

                <ol type="a">
            <li>
                Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improve and develop our products.

                            In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Athenets products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.
                        </p>

                            Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets of a small sampling of users' action data in ThoTh Lab we have taken steps to assist you to improve our learning services, such as providing instant advices or guidance to you and getting better education results.
